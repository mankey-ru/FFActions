# FFActions

Version: `1.4.1`

---

# OVERVIEW

FFActions is a Windows tool that adds simple right-click actions to quickly process multimedia files.

It is not meant to replace full editing, encoding, or retouching software. FFActions is designed for fast everyday operations, with simple interfaces and limited settings, so common tasks can be completed without opening a large application or navigating through advanced options.

The general idea is intentionally simple: short dialogs, focused options, and output files or folders created next to the original source file.

---

# HOW IT WORKS

FFActions integrates into the Windows context menu for supported video, audio, and image formats.

Each command launches a standalone tool based on PowerShell and FFmpeg. Every operation creates a new file or folder next to the source file and does not overwrite the original.

For format-based actions such as convert and audio extraction, FFActions now uses small picker windows instead of large nested format submenus. The installer rewires these entries directly to the picker executables so Explorer opens the compact button dialog immediately.

# USING THE SCRIPTS WITHOUT THE INSTALLER

This method is useful if you want to review the code, inspect the scripts, or run the tools manually without executing the Windows installer.

## What To Know First

Not every action is stored directly as a final ready-to-run script. A large part of the project is built around:

- template files in `actions\*.template.ps1`
- shared helper files in `actions\_shared\`
- a build script that combines them into usable final scripts

In practice, the flow is:

`template .ps1` -> `generated .ps1 script` -> `manual execution` or `compiled .exe`

## Requirements

Before running any action without the installer, make sure these files exist:

```text
tools/ffmpeg/ffmpeg.exe
tools/ffmpeg/ffprobe.exe
```

You should also open PowerShell in the project root folder, the one that contains `build_all.ps1` and `FFActions.iss`.

## Generate One Script

If you only want to test one feature, you can generate that final script directly from its template.

Example with `resize_image`:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\actions\build_ffaction.ps1 -TemplateFile .\actions\resize_image.template.ps1 -OutputFile .\actions\resize_image.ps1
```

`resize_image` needs no shared helpers. Other templates need theirs passed with `-SharedFile` (see `build_all.ps1` for which ones), so the simpler way is to generate every script at once without compiling anything:

```powershell
.\build_all.ps1 -ScriptsOnly
```

## Run A Script Manually

Once the final script has been generated, you can launch it directly and pass the file to process as an argument.

Example:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -STA -File .\actions\resize_image.ps1 "C:\path\to\image.png"
```

The `-STA` mode is important for actions that open a Windows Forms interface.

Generated scripts locate `tools\` relative to the script itself, so they run straight from the project folder. `convert_video`, `convert_audio`, `convert_image` and `extract_audio` are each compiled into several executables and take the target format from the executable name; when running the script, pass that name with `-ActionName`:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -STA -File .\actions\convert_video.ps1 "C:\path\to\video.mkv" -ActionName convert_to_mp4
```

The format pickers (`*_picker.ps1`) still launch the compiled target executables from `actions\`.

## Rebuild All Scripts

If you want to rebuild every action in the project at once, use:

```powershell
.\build_all.ps1
```

This regenerates the scripts and can also rebuild the executables if the required build chain is available on the machine. Add `-ScriptsOnly` to regenerate the scripts without compiling the executables.

## Build Requirements

For full local builds, the project expects:

- PowerShell
- `Invoke-PS2EXE` available in the local environment
- Inno Setup for installer builds
- local FFmpeg binaries in `tools/ffmpeg/`

Example to rebuild all local executables:

```powershell
.\build_all.ps1 -Version 1.4.1
```

Example to build the installer after that:

```text
Open FFActions.iss with Inno Setup and compile the installer
```

The context menu entries (items, order, separators, icons) come from `tools\context_menu.psd1`. Compiling `FFActions.iss` runs `tools\build_menu_iss.ps1`, which turns that layout into the installer's registry code, so there is nothing to regenerate by hand.

## Dev Context Menu

To test the locally built executables from Explorer without the installer, register a separate `FFActionsDev` right-click menu (current user only, no admin rights needed):

```powershell
.\tools\dev_menu.ps1             # register or refresh
.\tools\dev_menu.ps1 -Uninstall  # remove
```

The menu runs `actions\*.exe` straight from the project folder, so rebuilt executables are picked up immediately. Items, labels, icons, order and separators come from `tools\context_menu.psd1`, the same layout the installer uses: edit it and run the script again to preview the menu before building a release. It does not touch the `FFActions` menu created by the installer.

## If You Never Want To Run The Installer

You can fully work with the project by:

1. reading the templates inside `actions\`
2. generating only the scripts you want to inspect or test
3. running those scripts manually on test files
4. reviewing the FFmpeg commands before execution

In other words, the installer is convenient for Windows right-click integration, but it is not required to audit or use the code.

---

# INSTALLATION

The standard installation uses Inno Setup.

It registers the Windows context menu entries and allows module selection by category:

- Video
- Audio
- Image

Main script:

```text
FFActions.iss
```

Release note:

Compiled installers and generated executables are better distributed through GitHub Releases than committed to the source repository.

---

# LIMITATIONS

FFActions is designed for speed and simplicity.

Advanced codec tuning, fine bitrate control, color profiles, subtitles, complex metadata, multi-track editing, and professional workflows are outside the intended scope of the project.

For advanced or highly precise work, a dedicated tool is a better choice.

---

# DEPENDENCIES

FFActions mainly relies on FFmpeg and FFprobe.
